**Hello!** 
This project is dedicated to exploring data about fanfiction on popular web-site _ArchiveOfOurOwn_ (https://archiveofourown.org/). I choose this site because it has a massive amount of data that can be nicely visualized.  

I used this Python libraries here: 
* _scrapy_ for crawling 
* _sqlite_ for storing data
* _pandas_ for operating with data 
* _matplotlib_ and _seaborn_ for visualizations 

Lately I plan to add some interactive plots with _plotly_ library.
